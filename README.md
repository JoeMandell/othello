# othello
In the tester there are two ways to run tests.
You can make a new function for your test and call it in main fucntion.
You can also input algorithms into the test functions and call it in main function.
You can have it so our algorithms can play as White or Black but input stays the same (OurAlgorithm, Opponent)
