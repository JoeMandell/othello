# othello
In the tester there are two ways to run tests.
You can make a new function for your test and call it in main fucntion.
You can also input algorithms into the test functions and call it in main function.
You can have it so our algorithms can play as White or Black but input stays the same (OurAlgorithm, Opponent)

A basic version of Monte Carlo tree search is present in the main code. Experimental approaches for AMAF and RAVE methods are in the MCTS-Optimization branch.
